## Usage

Instantiate the relevant class and call the `Process` method passing the filename.

```csharp
var datProcessor = new DatProcessor();

foreach (var file in Directory.GetFiles(@"D:\Games\Solar-Winds\ep1-the-escape", "*.dat"))
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Processing {file}");
    var images = datProcessor.Process(file, @"D:\Games\Solar-Winds\ep1-the-escape\bh_mp1.dat");

    foreach (var image in images)
    {
        var f = Path.GetFileNameWithoutExtension(file);
        var fileName = @$"D:\data\solarwinds\\{f}_{images.IndexOf(image)}.png";
        image.SaveAsPng(fileName);
        Console.WriteLine($"Saved {fileName}");
    }
}
```
